# License Plate Recognition using CNN and CNN-LSTM

## Descriptions

This project implements and compares **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and **CNN-LSTM** methods for **Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR)**. The goal is to recognize alphanumeric characters (A–Z and 0–9) from vehicle license plates using deep learning approaches.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Google Colab

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- Contains 36 labeled character classes (0–9, A–Z)
